# **12-Week Preparation Plan: Software Engineer III \- Embedded Systems & Silicon (Detailed)**

This plan is structured for a rigorous 12-week preparation cycle, balancing deep technical knowledge (C++/DSA/Architecture) with system-level thinking required for a senior role.

### **Key Resources & Action Items**

1. **C++:** Focus on the "Effective C++" series concepts, the C++ Core Guidelines, and modern concurrency features (C++17/20).  
2. **Architecture:** Look for resources from **ARM** (official documentation, *Cortex-M* series for practical embedded context), **RISC-V Foundation**, and **Xilinx/Altera** (for general FPGA concepts).  
3. **Practice:** Solve at least 3 high-quality LeetCode problems (Medium/Hard) per day, making sure to implement solutions using modern, clean C++.

This schedule is designed for deep learning, but remember to stay flexible. If you find one topic taking longer, adjust the plan slightly. Consistency is the most important factor\!

Good luck\! This is an ambitious but achievable path.
